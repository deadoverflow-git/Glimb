# Glimb
This Node.js tool allows you to upload posts from other accounts on your own account with little to no effort whatsoever!

## Overview
This script automates the process of uploading random posts from other Instagram profiles to your own profile. It utilizes the Instagram API to fetch posts from designated profiles and then uploads them to your profile with proper attribution.

Note: This script should be used responsibly and within the bounds of Instagram's API usage policies.

## How to use
Glimb uses Electron, so it is really easy to set up and user friendly. I haven't finished this project completely, there is a lot of room for improvements but I don't plan on updating this any further. Feel free to add your contributions!

First of all, install everything that is neccessary from *package.json*

```
npm install package.json
```

Then just enter the following command and you are good to go!
```
npm start
```

Make sure to enter *deadoverflow* as license.

Other than that, there is nothing else to mention. Enjoy using Glimb :)
